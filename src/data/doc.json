Sesame is now the ninth most common allergen. According to a 2019 study by Dr. Gupta, the top nine allergens among adults in the US are shellfish (7.2 million), milk (4.7), peanut (4.5), tree nut (3.0), fin fish (2.2), egg (2.0), wheat (2.0), soy (1.5) and sesame (0.5).","deep":"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that food allergies increased by 50% in children between 1997 and 2011. Although a few hypotheses exist, the root cause is still up for debate.

We picked the 100 most popular crackers from each of two massive grocery chains; Albertsons and its subsidiaries, and Whole Foods.","deep":"<strong>Why Albertsons?</strong> It is one of the biggest chains in the US and carries most crackers everyone is familiar with.

For the rest, we feel it is safe to purchase, either because the brand runs a sesame-free facility, or we know how it will be labeled, or we trust their manufacturing practices.","deep":"An example of a good response from Pepperidge Farms, “sesame has been identified as an allergen of growing concern, and as such, we want to provide the information our consumers need to evaluate our products.  We voluntarily call out sesame as such on our product labels and we would always detail the presence of sesame even if it was found in our flavors or spices.”","x":"0.85","y":"2.8","size":"0.75","front":"true"},{"id":"two","text":"But for <mark class=color-pink>36% of crackers</mark>, we have “no confidence”. We avoid these crackers. For many, this was because we received unclear or unconvincing responses to our inquiries, or they lacked knowledge about handling sesame as an allergen.","deep":"Two examples of bad responses: “We unfortunately cannot disclose the ingredients in our natural flavors as they are proprietary so they may or may not contain sesame,” and “We do not have the information you requested.

Would I (Russell), bring it into my own home knowing it definitely doesn’t contain sesame? Or could I just as easily ignore it because of clear labeling? These crackers were labeled “confident.” Alternatively, are we still not sure if the cracker contains sesame or not, even after looking at the label and calling the manufacturer? These were labeled “not confident.”"},{"type":"text","value":"If the label did not mention sesame, we sought additional information from the manufacturers. 42 brands produce the 200 unique cracker products we focused on. We looked at manufacturers’ websites and FAQ pages about allergens, emailed them, filled out contact forms, or called their customer support, in that order, until we understood their practices around cross-contact, cleaning, and labeling. If we could not reach them after trying all of these avenues, we considered them uncontactable."}]}
